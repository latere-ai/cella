# Changelog

What changed for whoever writes a manifest, runs `cellad`, or builds on the
packages, one section per release. A `v*` tag without a section here is
refused before it is pushed.

## Unreleased

- The vocabulary an authorization endpoint for Cella speaks is an
  importable package, `latere.ai/x/cella/authorizer`. Write the endpoint
  `CELLA_AUTHORIZER_URL` points at in Go and take the thirty-two actions
  of the identity spec's table as constants, the resource kind each one
  acts on from `Kind`, the whole table from `Vocabulary()`, and the three
  ceilings an allow may carry from `WireLimits`, rather than keeping a
  copy of the strings. The envelope on the wire is
  `latere.ai/x/pkg/authz`'s, and so are the stub and the conformance
  suite an endpoint passes; an endpoint built on
  `latere.ai/x/pkg/authz/server` with nothing behind it but a decider
  passes that suite with this vocabulary. `cellad` asks no authorizer
  yet: the configuration, the client and the guard are the identity
  spec's and are not built.

- The repository: the `cellad` binary serving its probes on two listeners,
  typed configuration from `CELLA_*` variables, the quality gate, and the
  design specs. Nothing creates a sandbox yet; the specs say what will.
- The design, revised after review: Cella is a control plane whose data
  plane is a driver in-process or a worker on your own infrastructure;
  the API group is `cella.latere.ai/v1`; five kinds (`Sandbox`, `Secret`,
  `Volume`, `SandboxSet`, `Environment`); an egress gateway that keeps
  secret values out of sandboxes; volumes for persistent state; mesh and
  spawn with a boundary a child cannot widen; three scheduling
  strategies and sets for rollouts; desired state that recovers a lost
  sandbox; six drivers across four isolation classes.
